# World-Happiness
STAT 215: Applied Statistics with R project

## Abstract
Even when happiness is mainly under individual control, the outer world can affect it. Like what is happening to the country and the social life and culture. The World Happiness Report team did a great job collecting data and making surveys to give every country a happiness score, and they provided the dataset that was used.
Multiple linear regression is used to fit a model that can predict the happiness score of countries. The model depends on social support, life expectancy, freedom, and corruption perception. Also, to classify the countries as happy and not happy, a logistic model was used where the dependent variable became binary. The logistic model depends on social support, life expectancy, and freedom.

## The scientific goals
• Explore the dataset across the years and regions, and if COVID-19 left an effect on the world's happiness.
• investigate the collinearity and the correlation between factors.
• Create a model from the original data for the year 2021.
• Simple prediction for happy and non-happy countries (logistic regression).
